      "description": " Prior to my career change into the tech industry, I worked Air Transportation for the United States Air Force.  I enjoyed supporting missions that had real impacts all over the world but after talking to some friends who worked in the tech industry, I knew that I wanted a job that was more challenging and engaging. In preparation for my career change, I started my degree in computer science at UMGC. I had a great programming foundation but wasnâ€™t very familiar with building modern applications and using technologies that employers were looking for. To help with this, I joined Code Fellows and am learning full stack web development. Iâ€™m excited to take my leadership and communication skills learned in the Air Force, along with my software developer skills, and get a job in the tech industry",
